        <h3>SP Market 6/12/2023</h3>
        <p>The overnight session has traded higher above Friday’s close, meaning there is currently more demand for contracts than there is supply. It is also above the price 4305, which as we can see has previously been a price that elicits 
            strong responsive selling (on the 5th during the middle of the regular session and on the 7th at the beginning of the session).</p>
        <p>Friday’s distribution was mostly normal, and its open was a drive-reverse. Normal distributions mean that both buyers and sellers are acting responsively when the price of the security moves away from the aggregate value or the mean. 
            Opening drives mean that the market is out of balance or responding to change in a unidirectional way. It also traditionally means that a class of participants have conviction about their positions and have made their minds before 
            seeing the days auction.</p>
        <p>In this case, the higher open and its drive were at new, higher prices. That these prices didn’t continue to trade most likely is the result of responsive activity by participants with opposing sentiment, but of course, is also enabled 
            by the flexibility of demand. Notably there is responsive buying at prices that were previously levels where selling was the responsive action: $429-ish.</p>
        <p>Given all this, a weekly line-in-the-sand for long positions would be established at this SPY price–$429. I am inclined to describe this LIS as Friday’s point of control, because this level is the result of new price action above previous 
            resistance and the distribution of volume so close to this month-start range. For long positions to be structurally valid demand around these levels–and no lower–must be seen.</p>
        <p>Short positions make more sense so long as activity stays below $432. Structurally speaking, initiative selling within Friday’s range would be indicative that there is not currently enough demand in the market to require higher prices to
            complete auction activity. If the value area remains depressed around 430 for too long, the market will rotate lower to seek stronger demand. This most readily means back into its previous range where demand was strong at 426. Inside of 
            this range demand could appear suddenly with conviction, but below $426 it’s unlikely that there would be much initiative buying activity.</p>
        <p>On the longer timeframe, prices are high and this level of $430 is historically relevant. The economic data being released this week and the Federal Reserve Rate decision that is being made on Wednesday makes it much more difficult to 
            understand the market’s context.</p>
