          Our brains are made up of billions of neurons which form complex circuitry that results in everything we do. While most cells are small and self-contained like red blood cells, neurons are not; “zillions” of red blood cells can fit on the tip 
          of a reasonably dull pencil, but we have neurons in our spinal cords that span almost the length of our bodies. Since the function of neurons is to transmit information to other neurons they are long, skinny, and have two distinct ends; one 
          for talking and listening. But neurons don’t just talk to one other neuron, they talk to many, so the ends of neurons look most like tree branches that stretch out to interact with many other neurons. The “information” that travels along 
          neurons is an electrical signal that exists because of complex chemical processes. Neurons achieve electrical charge by usage of what are essentially gates and pumps that activate when the branches of the listening end–called dendrites–receive 
          a chemical signal from the speaking end of another neuron, called axon terminals. The nervous system is about contrasts, unambiguous extremes between having something and nothing to say, maximizing signal to noise ratios. Because contrast 
          between the binary of action and inaction are so important to communication, neurons use active processes to maintain these two states.
       </p>
       <p>
          When dendrites get a signal from the axon terminals of another neuron, they open “gates” that allow electrically charged ions into and down the neuron. When a neuron isn’t experiencing an action potential it uses pumps to expel positively 
          charged ions to make the intercellular space negatively charged, so that when a signal is received, the negative internal charge facilitates the movement of positive ions like sodium and potassium into the neuron. But neurons aren’t just 
          electrical cords plugged into a socket where if there is a good connection electricity flows through the length of the cord, neurons have hundreds of thousands of dendrites and axon terminals that connect to just as vast a number of neurons:
          sometimes 10,000 or more. One dendrite receiving a signal and opening its local gates and channels to allow positive ions to flow is not enough to excite a neuron; it just isn’t enough energy, especially with the activation of the pumps 
          that maintain the neuron’s negatively charged resting potential shortly after. For a neuron to create an action potential the neuron has to experience signaling from enough dendritic spines to open yet another threshold, this one at the 
          base of the neuron’s trunk, called the Axon Hillock–the qxon itself is the long trunk part of the neuron.
       </p>
       <p>
          The axon hillock is the final threshold that gatekeeps the execution of an action potential, it is made up of the same voltage-gated sodium channels that activate on the dendrites but in much greater density and gates the body of the neuron 
          with the neurons qxon–it’s highway. The fundamental characteristic of the axon hillock is that it requires “summation” from the signals it is receiving. As dendrites open and close their sodium channels in response to other neuron’s action 
          potentials, the positively charged ions propagate towards more negatively charged space and thus the axon hillock. If this happens in enough of the neuron’s dendrites the voltage-gated sodium channels in the axon hillock open and allow for 
          an action potential to occur.
       </p>
       <p>
          When an action potential occurs, there is a change in the characteristic of the signal inside the neuron. Before the axon hillock opened and allowed for the action potential to shoot down the neuron, the signal was the analogue culmination 
          of all the dendrite activity. It is a negative charge that changes slowly based on new inflow from dendrites as their voltage-gated channels are opened by a “previous” neuron’s action potentials, maybe from -70 to -60 millivolts. Once this 
          negative charge is positively changed enough to open the hillock somewhere around a still negative -40 mV and the sodium channels at the hillock open, a chain reaction starts that creates a positive, lossless, binary or digital signal that 
          flies down the neuron to the axon terminals. This positive charge is achieved by chain reaction and the continuous opening of channels along the axon, triggered by the presence of positively charged ions.
       </p>
       <p>
          This is where the computation of neurons occurs; between the dendrites that receive information from other neurons and the axon hillock that gatekeeps the continuation of the signal to its own axon terminals. The axon hillock essentially sets 
          the condition under which a neuron activates and joins the conversation. A neuron is like a mathematical function in which every dendrite is an input term and every axon terminal is a term of the output. Neurons create logic structure where
          the states of every neuron that connects to it’s dendrites is a condition. The sensitivity of an axon hillock changes over time from nutritional, hormonal, and experiential influences.
       </p>
       <p>
          The signal that passes between two neurons from an axon terminal to another’s dendrite is not electrical and neurons don’t actually touch each other either; there are gaps called synapses that facilitate a chemical transaction between them. 
          This translation that occurs in the axon terminal allows for drastically more complex information to be transferred between two neurons; for one, it allows either amplifying or inhibiting chemicals to be communicated which changes the flow
          of ions in the post-synaptic neuron. The chemicals that are transacted during this synaptic process are called neurotransmitters.
       </p>
       <p>
          The axon terminals of a neuron hold neurotransmitters in vesicles that release quantities of a given neurotransmitter whenever an action potential reaches this talking end of a neuron. Voltage sensitive gates open in the presence of the 
          electrical signature from an action potential and allow calcium ions to flow inward in the same way sodium comes into a post-synaptic neuron. Calcium ions then bind to the vesicles and initiate a protein complex that finds the vesicles 
          bound and fused to the membrane of the neuron, allowing the release of their neurotransmitter payload into extracellular space, across which is another neuron and it’s receiving dendrites. On the dendrites of the listening neuron are 
          receptors that are specifically sensitive to the shape of only a certain neurotransmitter. When these chemicals are present in the synaptic cleft their chemical signature is attracted to the receptor and elicits a change from the mechanisms
          that cause dendrites to open their channels and gates.
       </p>
       <p>
          The change in the dendrite of a post-synaptic neuron makes neurotransmitters quickly detach from the receptor, leaving it cluttering the synaptic cleft. There are two cleaning mechanisms that prevent the prolonged presence of neurotransmitters 
          in the synapse. The first is a reuptake process executed by the talking neuron’s axon terminal in which pumps are activated that attract the chemical signature of specific neurotransmitters and then redistribute them to vesicles for further 
          use. If this fails because of changes in the chemical signature or failure in the reuptake system, an enzyme breaks down the neurotransmitter in the extracellular space. These “housekeeping” mechanisms are a very important part of the 
          regulation of neurochemical signaling between two neurons, and the chemical element of neuron communication is very important to information exchange.
       </p>
       <p>
          There are many different types of neurotransmitters and they have all have varying effects whenever they bind to the post-synaptic neuron. The most fundamental difference between neurotransmitters is their effect on the depolarization process 
          that occurs when the gates and channels open to change the electrical state of the neuron. The chemical signature of different neurotransmitters and the structure of it’s reception system modulate the neuron in different ways, some 
          neurotransmitters cause more positive ion inflow than others. Some neurotransmitters even do the opposite and inhibit the eventual summation of a action potential by operating channels and pumps that make the neuron even more negatively 
          charged by introducing negatively charged ions.
       </p>
       <p>
          It’s understood that neuron’s have a distinct neurochemical profile in that action potentials always release the same type of neurotransmitter from all of the neuron’s axon terminals.
