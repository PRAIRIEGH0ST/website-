        <h3>July 4<sup>th</sup>, 2023</h3>
        <p>Let's try everything:</p>
        <p>
            It's July 4th, the most fun holiday of the year, where everyone spends all day outside socializing and playing games and whatever. I am inside, solo queuing CSGO with a weird
            headache/sore throat thing because of the THC concentrate pen I have been smoking for the past several weeks. I finished one 1g cart, and threw out 4 more that were basically full.
            I psychologically couldn't get comfortable without smoking it, and then after I smoke I had a bunch of fun with myself and didn't really want to give in to sleep. It really nukes something
            to do with REM, because I haven't had deep sleep since I started doing it. The more nights that passed with my routine being to start smoking as late into the evening as I could manage--usually 
            that's right at sundonw, was the sort of rule--the harder it became to fall asleep and the worse I felt high. This past week I wasn't even getting fucking high from the things, so paired with my
            sore throat and headache I decided I've gotta just bite the bullet on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This THC pen thing caused me a lot of fucking grief, and because my memory is so god damn horrible I can't remember what gave me the bright idea to start doing it in the first place. I have friends, AJ and Ummay, who
            smoke weed like it is nothing and they are far more functional than me through a frame I commonly use. Some time at the beginning of May, or early April, I went over there and took one or two drags on a joint, and it was 
            awesome. At about this time is when I decided to tell my mom that I didn't give a fuck about the community college classes in which I was enrolled. I told her somewhat confidently that I was going to trade my way out of 
            the life-hole I am in, and that I wanted a bit of money to start with. She is all set up, on account of the divorce, so she wrote me a check for two grand and said "[I love you, I want you to be happy, etc...]". I had been 
            carrying around <cite>Mind Over Markets</cite> for a couple weeks and read about a third of the way through before I started to resist it, for whatever reason. I took the money and put 1,500 into my brokerage and 500 onto my credit card.
            I can't remember the trades, which is all I really need to say, right? I was at 2,200 dollars by the end of the second day, but talked evil to myself as I let it draw down to about 300 by the end of the next week.

            I never feel like I'm telling the truth when I write like this, or even when I talk about this sort of thing. I don't know what to make of it. Rarely am I in a mood that finds me wanting to write as well as emotionally open enough to accept 
            whatever narrative ends up on paper or screen. Over years, this, and other things that I'll save the reader from, has led me to the conclusion that I have a fundamental problem with an Identity Object <em>within</em> my inner world. I've played 
            around with this and the way it feels verifies the validity of this idea in some ways. I've found that whenever I am most happy and feel like I'm acting most like myself, there exists something in my head that is not always there, all the time. To me,
            if feels like an Identity itself, because when my head feels this way there is a something being referenced that usually is not, and that something must be Me. Paired with a much more vivid feeling of being in control, I just have to treat it like this is real. 
            This idea came pretty immediately as I read <cite>A Guide For The Perplexed</cite>, a book which I called out of ChatGPT one day and pulled from an Amazon Warehouse the next. It is pretty interesting, I think, and the models that he produces seem to adress 
            some very fundamental ideas and account for a lot of dissonance I've struggled with in the past several years. But still, I am very skeptical about whether or not journaling like this is a good habit, especially if I don't always feel like I'm producing 
            genuine "pink matter". I'll continue on, avoiding what I'm reluctant to talk about by describing some more things I'm ashamed to tell:
        </p>
        <p>
            After I lost this money I probably lost my shit way worse than I'm remembering now. I remmeber crying a bit or a lot even, and feeling absolutely worthless in every way someone can be worthless. It's pretty easy for me to develop tangible logic about my worthlessness 
            due to extensive practice and the reality of my position being pretty disgusting in the first place. So, it's a hard thing to get ahold of, is what I mean. But <cite>A Guide For The Perplexed</cite> helped quite a bit, I think. It structured the world in a way familiar 
            and natural to me that I lost at some unknown point. I need to continue with reading it, and I need to fix my reading habits in general because I know that if I'm going to get where I want to go, reading like it's my job is going to be a foundational characteristic of my
            actions. Right no I turbo read something new and then spend days without continuing, breaking the original high and garenteeing I don't feel as good about reading as I originally did. I have to state here that I feel like this is mostly a chemical reality, especially considering
            my THC usage and my on and offness with taking vitamins and Emergen-c and exercising. I certainly feel like I'm getting better at all of this, but I knew as I did it that the THC was fucking with me. So, hopefully being off the THC will fix my ability to get REM, which 
            should fix some giga resonances with my ability to focus and wake up in the morning. Surely, right.

            If smoking a THC pen is such an obvious self sabotage, how did I come to getting one in the first place. I remmeber being confident in my ability to manage it and confident in my progress and position in the context of my goals and such. Mostly though, it just felt like there was something
            missing, and I think this was the bigger driver.

        <blockquote><em>See, one of the thing about writing pink matter is that I have no structured way to describe or translate these things, so I leave myself dubious to all sorts of psychological motivations for saying all sorts of things.</em></blockquote>

            I'm trying so hard not to talk about what seems to come next, because I've made the outright decision that by my own consequences the matter is concluded, and there's nothing to gain from talking about it. Still, it seems like typing is at any rate a good way to sneak up on 
            things unknown. But there is the common problem that I seem to have with assumptions and the reality that even participating in any relationship with another person requires these things. In <cite>"A Guide"'s</cite> explaination of the 2<sup>nd</sup> "field of knowledge" he explains that there is a skill
            in understanding the inner world of other people. Of the four fields described by the author this is definitely my most difficult. He explains that because humans are higher beings that these higher, or more inner, worlds are more important to reality than the physical world, or even the higher-than-physical
            realm of conciousness--remembering that the distinction between humans and other animals is that we are essentially conciousness<sup>2</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To detour backwards, E.F. Schumacher, the author of <cite>A Guide For The Perplexed</cite>, opens his book by explaining that he is attempting not to answer the deep questions of human existence, but just create a "Philosophical Map" with which the reader can use to better understand the various world in which humans exist.
            He explains that there are simply 4 "Levels of Being" on which all of the observable universe falls. The first is the material world; the realm of chemistry and physics that finds matter interacting with matter. The second is the level at which even the most simple forms of life operate, where existant things grown and 
            interact with their enviorments, exerting change. Then, higher than this still, is conciousness; animals that have thinking organs who can udnerstand the enviorment around them, make decisions about actions, and operate seemingly as individuals. In chicago, a bit before I got kicked out of Loyola, I thought about something similar: I was obsessed with 
            power and started to dicotomize power in a very similar way. My material level was called "existant power", which essentailly described the inherent power anything that exists at all has. My understanding was that to exist means to be precieved, and that being precieved by something means that there is influence, no matter how small. To take this to the level
            of the physical world, an asteroid flying through space, millions of miles from another asteroid certianly exists because it is interacting with spacetime and all the forces that are interacting with it. It's apart of the system. When two asteroids collide, they are both influencing each other through their existence. I don't know, when I was thinking of these things, they made 
            more sense because I cared about them so much more. Somewhere I left my passionate engagement with philosophy in my head, probably when I started to feel more and more like a quack. But, my power heirarchy had many many levels, and the farther up a being got, the more control they had on the prior levels. I accounted for the social power of celebrities and the economic power of governments and corporations, and all that good stuff.
